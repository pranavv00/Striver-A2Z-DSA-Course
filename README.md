# Introduction
In this README, I'll document my progress through the Striver A2Z DSA Series. I aim to consolidate all my learnings, code implementations, and notes here for easy reference and sharing with others. This repository will serve as a personal knowledge base and a resource hub for fellow learners.

# Learning Goals
-Mastering Data Structures: Understanding the core concepts and implementation of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

-Algorithms Proficiency: Learning and implementing essential algorithms like searching, sorting, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.

-Problem-Solving Skills: Enhancing problem-solving abilities through regular practice of coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.

-Interview Preparation: Preparing thoroughly for technical interviews by solving real-world problems, understanding different approaches, and optimizing solutions.
